# Flutter Interact GDG Cloud Rome
## Extract a gift
This repo contains the source code of the Codelab that I prepared for the Flutter Interact GDG Cloud Rome event.
It is an extension of the two Write Your First Flutter App parts.

This is the url of the codelab https://fabriziocacicia.github.io/flutter-interact-gdg-cloud-roma-extract-gift/
